The `sockets interface` is a set of functions that are used in conjunction with the Unix I/O functions
to build network applications.

It has been implemented on most modern systems.

a typical client-server transaction.


> Overview of network applications based on the sockets interface.
### Client
open_clientfd[getaddrinfo->socket->                connect] | rio_writen    | rio_readlineb | close
### Server
open_listenfd[getaddrinfo->socket->bind->listen] | accept   | rio_readlineb | rio_writen    | rio_readlineb | close

### Socket address structures
```c

/* IP socket address structure */
struct sockaddr_in {
    uint16_t sin_family;        /** Protocol family (always AF_INET) */
    uint16_t sin_port;          /** Port number in network byte order */
    struct in_addr sin_addr:    /** IP address in network byte order */
    unsigned char sin_zero[8];  /** Pad to sizeof(struct sockaddr) */
};

/** Generic socket address structure (for connect, bind, and accept) */
struct sockaddr {
    uint16_t sa_family:   /** Protocol family */
    char sa_data[14];     /** Address data */
}
