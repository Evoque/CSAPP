```c
char **cpp;
```
*cpp* is a pointer to an object that itself is *a pointer to an object of type char*. e.g. `type *T`

- The special `void *` type represents a generic pointer；the *malloc* function returns a generic pointer。
- Pointer types are *not* part of machine code; they are an abstraction provided by C to help programmers avoid addressing errors.
- **Every pointer has a value**: the speciall NULL(0) value indicates that the pointer does not point anywhere.
- **Pointers are created with the '&' operator**: This operator can be applied to any C expression that is categorized as an `lvalue`.
- **Pointers are dereferenced with the '*' operator**: The result is a value having the type associated with the pointer. Dereferencing is implemented by a memory reference, either storing to or retrieving from the specified address.
- Arrays and pointers are closely related
- Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value.
- Pointers can also point to functions:
```c

int fun(int x, int *p);

// we can  declare and assign a pointer fp to this function
int (*fp)(int, int *);
fp = fun

// we can then invoke the function using this pointer:
int y = 1;
int result = fp(8, &y);

// => The value of a function pointer is the address of the first instruction in the machine-code 
// representation of the function.

```
